Description: Asynchronous event notification library (openssl)
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
 .
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 There is now a bufferevent type that supports SSL/TLS using the
 OpenSSL library.  The code for this is build in a separate
 library, libevent_openssl, so that your programs don't need to
 link against OpenSSL unless they actually want SSL support.
